        <p>At the beginning of the covid pandemic, no one was sure what was in store and how long we would be stuck in isolation. 
            <br> When the world started shutting down, My girlfriend Thea and I fled to my family's house on Lopez Island to wait out what we thought would just be a couple of weeks of chaos on the mainland.
            <br> Days passed.....weeks passed.... and a few months later reality had set in and I realized I was going to be waiting out the pandemic indefinetly.
            <br>
            <br>We had hardly left the property during that period, relying on our garden and deliverys for food. I was going crazy from the absense of structure in my life.
            <br>As a way to keep myself entertained, I downloaded some software called <i>SketchUp</i> and started <a href="Sketch.html">designing a small cabin.</a>
