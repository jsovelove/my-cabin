    <p>"hmm, this could make a nice little homestead" I thought to myself. 
    <br>Later that week I kept pondering the prospect of making a little homebase for myself.
    <br>For fun, I decided to take a walk around the woods of my parents property to see where I would want to build this hypothetical structure.
    <br>As I meandered through the thickets, I came to a small clearing back behind my dad's shop.
    <br>"This spot. This could be a nice little spot!".
    <br>I imagined a whimsical scene. My girlfriend and I making tea in my tiny house in the forest, tending to the garden, chopping firewood in the rain, stoking a fire in a little cast iron stove.
    <br>I ran to my dad's shop and grabbed his chainsaw, <a href="clearspot.html">manically firing it up and chopping away at the vines and bushes.
