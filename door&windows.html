    <h1>The Dutch Door</h1>
    <p>After getting the cabin all dried in. I put the project on hold to go back to school.
    <br> When summer came back around, I picked the project back up and started working on the doors and windows.
    <br> Someone I worked for over the summer was nice enough to give me this old door, which I decided to cut in half.</p>

    <h1>The Windows</h1>
    <p>Thea's parents had some old single pane window sashes from their house which they let me use in the cabin. Because they are just sashes, I had to build the casing for each window. I'm still currently working on this project.</p>
