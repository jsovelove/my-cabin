    <p>A few days later, I had myself a jobsite. 
    <br>I had some money saved up and nothing but time, so I decided pull the trigger on this idea. I went the lumber yard and picked myself up some beams.
    <br>carpentry was a new endevour for me, but luckily my dad has done it most of his life so I utilized his knowledge throughout the project.
    <br>After about a week of learning how to use a string line, digging holes, scrutinizing over the position of a bubble and chopping posts to size, <a href="foundation.html">I was out of the dirt.</a>
