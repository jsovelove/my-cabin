    <p>The framing process was a ton of fun.
    <br> I was able to source a lot of the framing materials for free from a friend who was demoing an old skatepark he had built. 
    <br> But unfortunatly progress came to a hault because I ran out of money to continue.
    <br>I had decided to try and build a cabin when building materials were at <b>an all time high.</b>
    <br>So I decided to use the skills I had been gaining and get a job doing carpentry while I waited for lumber prices to drop back down.
    <br>Once I got a few paychecks, <a href="morework.html">I continued the project.</a>
